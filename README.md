# GreyhoundCAD

GreyhoundCAD is an open-source 2D CAD project that aims to provide a lightweight, user-friendly, and extendable CAD solution. The project is currently in its early stages of development, focusing on setting up the program structure and core classes. 

## Features (Planned)

The following features are planned for inclusion in GreyhoundCAD:

- Basic drawing tools (lines, circles, rectangles, etc.)
- Layer management
- Snap and grid functionality
- Object selection and manipulation
- Undo/Redo functionality
- Export to common file formats (DXF, SVG, etc.)
- Customizable user interface
- Plugin system for extending functionality

## Dependencies

GreyhoundCAD currently has the following dependencies, which are included within the project:

- GLFW
- NanoVG

## Why Another CAD Package?

While there are already great open-source CAD solutions available, such as LibreCAD and FreeCAD, GreyhoundCAD aims to offer a distinct approach. Here's why we are creating another CAD package:

- **Lightweight**: GreyhoundCAD focuses on providing a lightweight solution, minimizing resource usage while maintaining essential functionality.

- **User-Friendly**: We strive to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making the CAD experience more accessible to users, regardless of their level of expertise.

- **Extendable**: GreyhoundCAD aims to be highly extendable through a plugin system, allowing users to customize and enhance the software according to their specific needs.

- **Built from the Ground Up**: By starting from scratch, we have the opportunity to design and implement the core functionalities with a modern and optimized approach.

- **Free Forever**: Our long-term vision is to develop GreyhoundCAD into a professional-grade CAD program that can compete with costly proprietary solutions. By being open source and community-driven, we aim to provide a powerful CAD tool free of charge, eliminating the need for exorbitant pricing
