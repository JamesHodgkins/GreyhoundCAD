# GreyhoundCAD

GreyhoundCAD is an open-source 2D CAD project that aims to provide a lightweight, user-friendly, and extendable CAD solution. The project is currently in its early stages of development, focusing on setting up the program structure and core classes. 

## Features (Planned)

The following features are planned for inclusion in GreyhoundCAD:

- Basic drawing tools (lines, circles, rectangles, etc.)
- Layer management
- Snap and grid functionality
- Object selection and manipulation
- Undo/Redo functionality
- Export to common file formats (DXF, SVG, etc.)
- Customizable user interface
- Plugin system for extending functionality

## Dependencies

GreyhoundCAD currently has the following dependencies, which are included within the project:

- GLFW
- NanoVG

## Why Another CAD Package?

While there are already great open-source CAD solutions available, such as LibreCAD and FreeCAD, GreyhoundCAD aims to offer a distinct approach. Here's why we are creating another CAD package:

- **Lightweight**: GreyhoundCAD focuses on providing a lightweight solution, minimizing resource usage while maintaining essential functionality.

- **User-Friendly**: We strive to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making the CAD experience more accessible to users, regardless of their level of expertise.

- **Extendable**: GreyhoundCAD aims to be highly extendable through a plugin system, allowing users to customize and enhance the software according to their specific needs.

- **Built from the Ground Up**: By starting from scratch, we have the opportunity to design and implement the core functionalities with a modern and optimized approach.

- **Free Forever**: Our long-term vision is to develop GreyhoundCAD into a professional-grade CAD program that can compete with costly proprietary solutions. By being open source and community-driven, we aim to provide a powerful CAD tool free of charge, eliminating the need for exorbitant pricing

## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the creators and contributors of existing open-source CAD solutions, whose invaluable contributions have played a pivotal role in shaping and advancing the field of computer-aided design. Their dedication, expertise, and innovation have paved the way for projects like GreyhoundCAD to exist.

Throughout the development of GreyhoundCAD, we have strived to leverage the collective knowledge and expertise of the open-source community. In doing so, we have consciously utilized certain portions of code from these projects to enhance our software's capabilities and provide a comprehensive CAD experience. We would like to acknowledge that we have knowingly incorporated and adapted code from various open-source CAD projects.

Wherever possible, we have made every effort to ensure that appropriate credit is given to the original creators and contributors of the code we have utilized. We believe that acknowledging their efforts is not only a sign of respect but also a way to foster collaboration and promote the continued growth of the open-source community.

We extend our deepest appreciation to all those who have generously shared their code, ideas, and expertise, enabling us to build upon their work and create GreyhoundCAD. Without their contributions, our journey would have been significantly more challenging, and our software would not be what it is today.

Thank you for your interest in GreyhoundCAD! We are committed to developing a CAD program that not only meets your needs but also exceeds your expectations.
